I've been writing a Python macro for FreeCAD as a learning exercise on both subjects. I thought it would be nice to 
display the [Circled Information Source](https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f6c8/index.htm) unicode character
as a tooltip icon in a GUI form. It looks like this: &#x1f6c8; (if your current viewing font supports it). 

After attempting this for a couple of hours, I wanted to stop learning Python and head back to Java...

Here are the things to look out for when using Python 2.7:

- As per [PEP 263](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/) a Python source file needs to start with:

    ```plaintext
    # coding: UTF-8
    ```
    
    **Note**: This isn't required in Python 3 as UTF-8 is the default encoding as per [PEP 3120](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3120/).

- UTF-8 [string literals](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammar-token-stringprefix) need 
to be prefixed with a `u` as follows:

    ```plaintext
    u"My UTF-8 string ðŸ›ˆ"
    ```

- Make sure to use a unicode character which has a code point less than the 
[sys.maxunicode](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.maxunicode) for your build of Python!
  This one was a real doozie to uncover. Here are some other devs [dealing with the same issue](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1446456)   
    
    **Note**: Again things change in Python 3.3 as per [PEP 393](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0393/).

    Within the FreeCAD 18.0 Python terminal:
    
    ```plaintext
    Python 2.7.15 (default, Aug 22 2018, 16:41:11) 
    [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 8.0.0 (clang-800.0.42.1)] on darwin
    Type 'help', 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information.
    >>> App.setActiveDocument("Unnamed")
    >>> App.ActiveDocument=App.getDocument("Unnamed")
    >>> Gui.ActiveDocument=Gui.getDocument("Unnamed")
    >>> import sys
    >>> print sys.maxunicode
    65535
    >>> 
    ``` 
 
    Of course &#x1f6c8; has a decimal value of 128712 which is TOO BIG! So I've settled on using the 
    [Information Source](https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2139/index.htm) character &#8505;
    which has a decimal value of 8505.
