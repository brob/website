I finished the DIY fit-out of my lab/office/study late last year. 

A lot of planning and design was done before I started cutting into flat-pack furniture with the circular saw. 

I'm very pleased with the result. This is a good thing as I'll be spending a significant portion of my life for the coming years here.
